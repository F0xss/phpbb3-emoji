# Convert emoji into HTML images for phpBB3

This is a work in progress MOD for phpBB3 that converts iOS emojis into HTML images. This MOD is based on dpaanlkaâ€™s work posted on [phpBB forums](https://www.phpbb.com/community/viewtopic.php?f=70&t=2111155).

Emoji images are mostly from [github/gemoji](https://github.com/github/gemoji). Any_SoftbankSMS.txt is from [Apple](http://opensource.apple.com/source/ICU/ICU-461.13/icuSources/data/translit/Any_SoftbankSMS.txt?txt).

## Installation

### 1. Update Database Schema to Support 4-Byte UTF-8

Instructions here are for MySQL only. To store 4-byte utf-8, MySQL version 5.5 and above is required. Change collation of `phpbb_posts.post_text` to `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`. Repeat this step for any other places, such as `phpbb_forums.forum_desc`, that may possibly store emoji.

Open `phpBB/includes/db/mysqli.php`, change:

```php
			@mysqli_query($this->db_connect_id, "SET NAMES 'utf8'");
```

to:

```php
			@mysqli_query($this->db_connect_id, "SET NAMES 'utf8mb4'");
```

### 2. Copy Files

* Copy `images/emoji` into `phpBB/images`
* Copy `styles/style/template/emoji.js` into `phpBB/styles/<your-style>/template`
* Copy `styles/style/template/jquery-1.8.2.min.js` into `phpBB/styles/<your-style>/template`  
  **Skip this step if your style already comes with jQuery!**

### 3. Add JavaScript Tags

Open `phpBB/styles/<your-style>/template/overall_header.html`, before

```html
<link href="{T_THEME_PATH}/print.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="print" title="printonly" />
```

add

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="{T_SUPER_TEMPLATE_PATH}/jquery-1.8.2.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="{T_SUPER_TEMPLATE_PATH}/emoji.js"></script>
```

__Do not add the jQuery line if your style already comes with jQuery!__

### 4. Update Stylesheet

Emoji images come at 64px x 64px, which would be too big. Open `phpBB/styles/<your-style>/theme/common.css` and add at the bottom:

```css
img.emoji {
	width: 1.5em;
	height: 1.5em;
}
```

### 5. Clear Cache

Go to phpBB admin and click clear cache.
